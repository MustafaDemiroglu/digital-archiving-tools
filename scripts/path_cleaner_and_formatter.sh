# Description:
#   Lists CSV files in the current working directory,
#   asks the user which one to process,
#   cleans paths by:
#       1. Removing '/media/cepheus/' prefix
#       2. Removing trailing filename
#       3. Keeping only the middle directory structure
#       4. Removing duplicate directory entries
#   Saves result into a new file with '_done.csv' suffix.
